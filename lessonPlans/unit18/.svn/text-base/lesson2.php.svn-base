<ul>

<li>Write a variety of questions on the board using interrogative words. Don't use interrogative pronouns or adjectives in the subject form for now, to illustrate a point. 
<br /><em>	 e.g. Where are you going?
<br />	        With whom did you eat?
<br />	        When have you seen anything that amazing?</em></li>
<li>Ask students to look closely at the verb forms and to figure out what happens to them when a question is asked? This does not work if the question word is a subject.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The personal pronoun, or whatever the subject is, and the helping verb switch places. They invert, turn over.</li>
		<li>You do not have to use an interrogative word to ask a question. Another way to ask a question is to use inversion, turn around the personal pronoun and the helping verb.</li>

			<td><strong>Are we</strong> going to the movies<strong>?</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<br /><br />
	
	<li>If there is no helping verb in the statement form, then one has to be added so it can be inverted.</li>

			<td><strong>Did he finish</strong> his work<strong>?</strong></td>

	<br /><br />
	
	<li>If the verb <em>to be</em> is the main verb, then no helping verb is added when inverting for a question. My brother is a writer.  Is your brother a writer? Why is your brother a writer?</li>
	<li>Practice inverting statements in different tenses.</li>
