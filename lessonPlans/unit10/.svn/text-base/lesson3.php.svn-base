Follow up from the homework. Put a dictionary between two students and have them look up some of their own commonly used English words to find the derivation. Share them with the class.
<br />
Have all of the pairs look up the word <strong>beauty</strong>. What is the derivation?
<br />
Now ask them to look before and after the word beauty in the dictionary to see if it changes into words with different functions.
<br />
<em>e.g. beautiful, beautify</em>

<ul>

<li>Words within a language can change their endings to be used in different ways. We can change the noun beauty into the adjective beautiful to describe a noun or into the verb beautify to do an action.</li>
<li>These different forms of a word are different parts of speech. Each part of speech has its own function.</li>
<li>Dividing words into different parts of speech is the most basic way of starting to look at what words can do, what their different roles are in a sentence.</li>
<li>Almost every language divides all of its words into the same parts of speech, and so this is one of the most basic things that languages have in common - the parts of speech - the building blocks of grammar.</li>
