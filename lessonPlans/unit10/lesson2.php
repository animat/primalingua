<li>What will English be like in 3000 years? Will it still be in use and called English? Will all of the dialects become so different that they are all named different languages?</li>
<li>Will all languages meld together into one or will there be even more languages in the world?</li>
<li>Review the Indo-European and Romance language trees. Can you use these trees as evidence that languages are constantly evolving and that more and more languages are always being created?</li>
