	 <ul>
<li>Linguistics is the study of language.</li>
<li>You are going to look at the numbers 1 - 10, 100, and 1000 in many languages. These can be found on p.36 and on the Number Wall on the website.</li>
<li>You will compare the words linguistically, looking at the sound groups that are used, to see if there are any similarities across languages. </li>

 		  
</div>

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	Project the Number Wall. Read through the numbers or click the
 numbers to hear what they sound like. Discuss the similarities found as listed below under discussion topics. It may take a few days to go through, copy down, and compare the twelve numbers in every language. 




</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Take note especially of words that look very different but are
  really connected because they use a word from the same sound group. e.g. vier and four,  duo and two and zwei (which can make a tsv sound,)  septem and sieben</li>
<li>Look for words that have roughly the same root.</li> 
<li>Take note of which languages are similar. </li>
<li>Look for derivatives of any of the words.</li>
<li>Note the languages that have masculine and feminine forms of the number one.</li>
<li>The Romance languages will usually be like Latin, but note when English is similar to the Latin and when it is similar to German.</li>
<li>Discuss the German influence on English as well as the Roman influence on English and refer to the Julius Caesar story of how conquering affected languages.</li>
<li>Discuss the Greeks' influence on the Romans, the Roman conquering of Greece and use of Greek slaves for pedagogues.</li>
<li>Write the Greek in the Greek alphabet if you can and also transliterate it. Discuss the difference between transliteration and translation.</li>
<li>All of these languages are connected historically to Indo-European, and so
even these languages that look and sound very different have similarities.</li>
<li>Perhaps even languages that are not connected historically to another root language have similarities in the way they work as languages. This is what we will look for in our study of the way languages work. </li>

<div class="Activity">

Each student will memorize the numbers 1 - 10 in at least three languages. Give them about a week to learn how to recite and write the numbers. 
Everyone will learn Latin, but they may choose the other two languages individually. If they want to do a language that you have not provided, then just have them bring in a written copy of this language for you. Call each student up for a private conference about which two languages he or she is choosing. Encourage them to learn ones they do not already know.
Discuss strategies for memorizing.
You can test them orally and in writing and ask them to do a linguistic comparison of the numbers in their three languages.
