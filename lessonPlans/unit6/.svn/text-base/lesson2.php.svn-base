	 put up the words for 1 - 10, 100, 1000 in Latin on the board from p.34, ask for derivatives using each number. Students should make a chart of the Roman numeral, the Latin word, and English derivatives in their notebooks although they will be redoing this information in their workbooks for homework. This is a good way to reinforce taking good notes.
The brainstorming of derivatives could be done in groups and then shared back with the whole class.
