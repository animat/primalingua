<h4>Day 1</h4>

<div class="Activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	 Make flash cards with Roman numerals. Choose a student to 
 stand in front of you. As you flash a card, the student says the Latin number.  Give a few students a turn.

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	Teach about the sound groups (from the chart on p.35) 
 into which some consonants fall by making the different sounds in a very pronounced manner and asking the students to repeat the sounds over and over. They should be aware of:<br /> 
    - where the sound is being made in their mouths <br />         
    - how that is connected to the name of the sound group<br />
    - whether they are using their voices or simply expelling air when making the sound.<br />
They can feel the air on their hands from their mouths. They can feel the guttural sounds with their hands on their throats.

		<li>In Classical Latin pronunciation, all g's and c's are guttural.

 </li>
		<li>In many other languages, g's and c's that are followed by e's and i's are soft, not guttural. <br /> 
e.g. giraffe, gem vs. guitar, gate; cinder, celery vs. cottage, carrot<br />
(Sesame Street has a great song to demonstrate this with Grover using guttural g words and George using soft g words.) 





</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	Divide students into groups of four. Have each group take a
 piece of paper and write the four sound groups on it. They should think of 10 words for each group, words that have those sounds in them; a variety of voiced and unvoiced; not all starting with the sound. These words will be used for a game tomorrow.

<ul>
<li>
Make four signs: Guttural, Dental, Labial, and Labio-Dentals 
</li>
<li>The groups from yesterday will become teams with these names.
</li>
<li>Put four desks side by side facing the front of the room. Put the team names on the desks. One member of each team sits at a desk while the rest of the players wait behind them in a straight line for their turn. The desk should also have on it a blank piece of paper for scoring points and a pen.</li>
<li>Collect the sheets of words that teams made yesterday. Call out a word that has a sound in it from one or more of the sound groups. </li>
<li>Each contestant must quickly figure out if their sound group is represented in the word. If so they will hold up their sign.<br /> 
  +1 for each contestant who did the right thing, holding up their sign or not holding it up.<br />
  -1 for each contestant who did the wrong thing, holding up their sign or not holding it up.<br />
Team member scores points in plus or minus column on their desk.<br /><br />

n.b. some words may have more than one sound group</li><br /><br />

<li>continue with a few words until seated contestants move tot he back of the line and the next contestants take a seat.</li>

		Before class ends, introduce the Number Wall from the website in Unit 6.
Tell students that they will be learning how to count to 10 in other languages. They can begin to explore this at home.
