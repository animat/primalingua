<h3>Lesson 1 - Transitive and Intransitive Verbs</h3>

<div class="day">
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<div class="items">

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	 
<ul>

<li>All students sit in a circle on the floor.</li>
<li>Give them a prop. (I use one of my stuffed frogs. It is helpful if you have a prop that is a word they know in Latin to use for these types of exercises.)</li>
<li>Ask each student to make the frog do something. As they are making the frog go through the motions, they are saying the noun-verb phrases. 
<br />
<em> e.g. the frog hops  -or-  the frog is hopping 
<br />         the frog eats   -or-   the frog is eating</em> </li>
<li>As each student takes a turn, write his verb on the board in its infinitive form.
<br />
<em> e.g. to hop, to eat</em>
<br />
But write the verbs in two unmarked columns, transitive in one list and intransitive in another. Do not tell the students what you are doing. 
<br />
(This can get tricky because so many intransitive verbs can be used as transitive verbs as well. Write them up the way the students are using them; you can talk about altering them later.)
<br />
If the verb "to be" comes up, write it in a third column.</li>
<li>Go around the circle as many times as you want until you have a good list of each type of verb.</li>
<li>Tell the students there is a difference between the two lists of verbs, but make them figure it out by asking you questions. 
<br />
After someone comes to the conclusion that one list does the action to another object and the other list does not, follow up with this discussion: </li>

</ul> 


	
</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>

<ul>

<li>A verb is usually an action word.</li>
<li>Some verbs do their action to another object. These are called transitive verbs.</li>
<li>You can ask the question What? after a transitive verb. 
<br />
<em> e.g. The frog loves what?</em>
</li>
<li>Transitive has the word trans = across in it. Think of the transitive verb as crossing over to something else. It needs something else to complete it.</li>
<li>The other verbs are intransitive verbs. They do not cross over to anything else, nor do they need another object to complete the phrase. They do not do their actions to something else. They can stand alone. 
<br />
<em> e.g. The frog jumps. You may want to ask the question where? after this but you do not need a what to complete it. 
(This is when the students figure out that if you say 'the frog jumps the fence' you are creating a what. Explain that some intransitive verbs can be used as transitive verbs.)</em>
