<h2>Unit 9 - Noun and Verb Functions</h2>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>Lesson 2 - Subjects and Direct Objects</h3>

<div class="day">
<h4>Day 1</h4>

<div class="items">

English grammar is somewhat abstract. We have to figure out what subjects and direct objects are without many clues. By looking at the inflections used in Latin, they will be able to see more clearly what the different functions of these nouns are. They will then be able to transfer this to less inflected languages. Inflections are handy tools we can use to mark the differences.

<div class="activity">
<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>

Write the headings <b>Transitive</b> and <b>Intransitive</b> on the board. Invite students to come up and write verbs under the appropriate columns. 
<br /><br />
Choose a verb from the intransitive column and make a sentence.
<br />
<em>e.g. The bird flies.</em>
<br />
Draw the shape of a cloud around 'the bird' and a squiggly line under the verb 'flies.' 
<br /><br />
Choose a verb from the transitive column and make a sentence.
<br />
<em> e.g. The bird eats a worm.</em>
Use the same symbols for subject and verb and add a box around 'a worm.'

<ul>

<li>The noun that does the action is called the subject.</li>
<li>The noun that receives the action or has the action done to it is called the direct object.</li>
<li>Transitive verbs take direct objects and intransitive verbs do not.</li>
<li>The function of a word is the role it plays in a sentence. A noun can have the function of being a subject or a direct object in a sentence.</li>

</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
The same circle activity from Lesson 1 but this time make your prop, the frog, the direct object. Actions will be done to the frog this time. 
<br />
<em>e.g. I am kissing the frog. Everybody hits the frog.</em>
<ul>
<li>First time around the circle: the students pass the frog so that each person can do an action to the frog.</li>
<li>Second time around the circle: the frog becomes the subject again, but each student becomes the direct object on his turn. 
<br />
<em> e.g. The frog kisses me. The frog bites me.</em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="discuss">
<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>

<ul>

<li>The role of the frog and the student changed.</li>
<li>The same word can be a subject at one time and a direct object at another.</li>
<li>Write some of the sentences from the circle on the board and have students draw the symbols around the subjects and direct objects.</li>

Offer a practice quiz with a few English sentences to indentify the type of verb and two functions of nouns. 
Or try one of the following activities: 

<div class="activity">
<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>

<ul>
<li>Have one student stand at the front of the room.</li>
<li>Another student calls out two random English nouns and decides that one will be a subject and the other will be a direct object.
<br />
<em> e.g. subject - elephant,  direct object - pizza</em>
</li>
<li>The first student must make up a sentence using these two nouns in these roles. 
<br />
<em>e.g. The elephant squashed the pizza when he stood on it.</em>
</li>
<li>After a few turns making up sentences, make it more difficult: they cannot begin the sentence with the subject. Show them how to add more detail. 
<br />
<em> e.g. One day early in the morning, a pink elephant squashed the mushroom pizza when he stood on it in the kitchen.</em>
</li>

</ul> 


</div>

<div class="activity">
<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>

<ul>

<li>Give each student a blank piece of paper with no lines.</li>
<li>Have them tear or cut the paper into 6 pieces.</li>
<li>Ask them to write a different noun on four of the pieces.</li>
<li>Put three large cards on the floor at the front of the room facing the students. 
<br /> 
 The cards say the following: 
<br /><br />
 SUBJECT - VERB - DIRECT OBJECT 
<br />
</li>
<li>Ask the students to put two of their noun slips of paper face down under the sign SUBJECT and the other two nouns face down under DIRECT OBJECT.</li>
<li>Have them write one intransitive verb and one transitive verb on their remaining slips of paper and place all of them under the sign VERB.</li>
<li>Each student takes a turn, one at a time, coming up and choosing a piece of paper from the subject pile and the verb pile. Now the student has to decide if he has a transitive verb or not. If he has chosen one that could be either, he can decide which he wants it to be.</li>
<li>If a transitive verb is chosen, he must pick a direct object. If it is intransitive, then he should not pick a direct object paper. Encourage them to ask the question what? after the verb to figure it out.</li>
<li>The student now has to make up a sentence with these words in these functions. write it on the board, and diagram it using the cloud, line, and box symbols (or whatever visual symbols you want to use for diagramming).</li>

</ul>

(Do this for as long as their interest holds. I have had students play this game for two days until all of the pieces of paper were used.)
