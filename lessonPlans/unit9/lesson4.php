<h3>Lesson 4 - Nominative and Accusative Cases </h3>

<div class="day">

Draw two suitcases on the board: one to hold all the endings that are for subjects, th eother to hold the new direct object endings. (n.b. we are not learning the plural endings for direct objects.)    THe suitcases will be named the Nominative Case and the Accusative Case to make the point that the case is a way to group endings that show the functions of the nouns. 

<div class="discuss">

<ul>
<li>Latin nouns belong to the same group, the same declension, if
 they have the same endings. <br />

So all the words that attach -a for subjects and -am for direct objects belong to 1st declension. <br />
All the words that attach -us / -r for subjects and -um for direct objects belong to 2nd declension. </li>
<li>The endings themselves belong to groups based on their functions.<br /> 
All endings that are used for subjects (-a and -us / -r) are in a group <br /> 
and <br /> 
all endings that are used for direct objects ( -am and -um) are in a group.<br />  
These groups are called cases.</li> 
<li>The case for subjects is called the nominative case.</li>  
<li>The case for direct objects is called the accusative case.
</li>  

</ul>

Assign a Latin noun to each student. (They know about 25 nouns
 at this point.) <br /><br />

The student writes the subject form/nominative case on one side of a piece of paper in big letters and the direct object form/accusative case on the other side.<br /><br /> 


You make up a sentence in English using nouns you know they have. Again use only the verb to love. <br /><br />


The students who have the nouns that you used in your sentence come forward and put their piece of paper on the floor next to the verb amat. 
They will have to decide if their noun is being used as a subject or direct object, and they will have to decide which form of their noun to put face up. <br />
It does not matter where they put their noun because the word order does not matter. <br />
Ask them questions about the case, declension, and function of their nouns. <br />
Try more complex English sentences in which the subject is not the first word in the sentence or use other verbs.
