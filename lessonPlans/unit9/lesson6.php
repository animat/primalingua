<ul>

<li>What type of verb is est / sunt?    
  It is not doing an action either alone or to something else; 

so it is neither a transitive nor an intransitive verb. </li>
<li>This verb, the verb to be, explains that one thing is equal to another. <br />
 The girl is a student.  The girl = a student.<br /> 
 They are small.  They = small.</li> 
<li>This type of verb is called a linking verb, because it links the subject to something equal to it.</li> 
<li>Just as the two things on either side of an equal side must be equal in math, so in language they must be equal. 
If the subject is in the nominative case then what it equals on the other side of the linking verb must be in the nominative case. </li>
<li>This type of nominative that comes after a linking verb is called a predicate nominative.

	Practice diagramming three types of sentences: <br /><br />


Transitive verb:  cloud, wiggly line, box   (for subject, verb, direct object) <br />
Intransitive verb:  cloud, wiggly line    (for subject, verb) <br />
Linking verb:  cloud = cloud       (for subject = predicate nominative) <br /><br />


Practice diagramming some simple sentences in Latin.

	Divide students into group of three to write a skit entirely in
 Latin that they will act out for the class.<br />
This works best if you tell them to write the script for one of them to narrate as the others act it out, since they can only write in 3rd person. <br />

They may only use words they know. It should be a creative use of all three types of sentences.<br /> 
The skits will be simple but can be very funny. <br /><br />


Spend a few days working on skits in class, maybe typing up and illustrating the script, practicing the performance, and finally a day of performances for the class.

 <a href="http://www.primalingua.net/lessonPlans/files/09-stripGame.doc">Strip Sentence Game</a>
  Cut the attached papers into strips. Line strips up on a table or floor in the classroom. <br />

Students work in pairs, come and grab the first sentence strip, run back to their seats and answer all the questions about the underlined word. <br />
One team member runs up to you, positioned at a desk in the front of the room to correct it. They will need to form a line as you work quickly. <br />
Assign two points if all answers are correct. Send them back to fix anything wrong. 1 point when everything is eventually correct. <br />
Then they work to translate the sentence and again run it up for correction. <br />
Again 2 points for correct the first time and 1 point when it is eventually correct. <br /><br />


Tips: students may not move to next strip until the first is correct. <br />
One strip at a time. No using books or notes. <br />
If they are absolutely stuck, start giving hints.<br /> 
The point is instant feedback, everyone is working, they work till they get it correct. <br />
No more than two people working together.

<b>Quiz Show</b> on the website  
 Put students in teams. They come to the front of the room and sit in chairs/desks facing each other. 

After they choose a character for their round of questions, they should discuss which answer they will choose out loud so the class can hear. Then they can click on the mulitple choice answers until they get it correct. 
The game will score points for each team. 


They can then use this game to review at home for the test. 


You can edit Quiz Show and add it to any unit with your own questions.
