Write the following list of Latin prepositions on the board. 
<br />
<em>ex, sub, in, pro, circum, ad, de, prope, ab, sine, cum, per, trans, ante, post</em>
<br /><br />
Ask for guesses at definitions. Encourage them to think of derivatives to make educated guesses. Act out those prepositions that cannot be guessed or offer derivatives, so that at least they are figuring out and presenting you with the definitions. Make a list of definitinos and derivatives of each preposition.
<br /><br />
Make up some games at LinguaZone.com to practice identifying Latin prepositions: Garden Grows, Splat, Ferris Wheel, Leap Frog, or Mantis.

<ul>

<li>Since the function of the noun after the preposition is a type of object, then in Latin we will    have to use an object case ending on the nouns.</li>
<li>For direct objects in Latin we use the accusative case.</li>
<li>For objects of prepositions two cases are used. Some prepositions are followed by objects in the accusative case, but some prepositions are followed by objects in a new case, the ablative case.
<br /><br />
Ablative endings: (I just do singular for now.)
<br />
1st declension:   - a
<br />
2nd declension:   - o
</li>
<li>There is an easy way to remember which prepositions use ablative and which use accusative for their objects. Memorize the following poem. If a Latin preposition occurs in the poem, it uses the ablative; if it is not in the poem, it uses the accusative.
<br /><br />
<strong>Ablative Preposition Poem</strong>
<br />
<em>
a, ab, ex, e
<br />
sine, pro, cum, de,
<br />
sometimes in
<br />
sometimes sub
<br />
always in the ablatub
</em>
</li>
<li>Explain that ab and a are the same word. Ab is used before vowels, a before consonants, and the same for ex and e.</li>
<li>Explain the difference between in and sub with the ablative and with the accusative.
<br />
<em>e.g. in aqua = in the water
<br />
in aquam = into the water</em></li>
</ul>

Write an extremely long Latin sentence full of prepositional phrases like the one done in English in the previous lesson. Make sure the objects of the prepositions are in the right case.
