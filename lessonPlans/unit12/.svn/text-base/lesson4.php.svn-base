<ul>

<li>Ask students to add some Latin adjectives to the objects of the prepositions up on the board.</li>
<li>Agreement of adjectives. The same rule applies for objects of prepositions. Adjectives will agree with the nouns they describe in case, number, and gender.</li>
<li>Follow the PowerPoint to introduce Latin prepositions as prefixes and how some of them assimilate when attached to a base word.</li>
<li>Sometimes the final letter of the Latin preposition will assimilate to the first letter of the word to which it is attaching. It becomes similar to it, so that the word will not sound awkward when it is pronounced.</li>
<li>The word assimilate itself is made from a form of the word similar and the Latin preposition ad: to make something similar to something else.
<br />
The final letter of ad changes to become the same as the first letter in similar, so that it is easier to say. So the word assimilation is, in fact, an example of assimilation.</li>

Complete page 100 with partners again in the lab or library.

Discuss how their vocabulary (not only in English) will grow by knowing these Latin prepositions.

Finding False Derivatives:
<br />
Students in teams of two or three. Give each team a game sheet. On the sheet are boxes with words, some of which are using Latin prepositions as prefixes and some of which are fake. 
<br />
Spend a day or two in a computer lab or library with dictionaries as they try to discover which ones are true and which are false. A good dictionary will give them the derivation and list the Latin preposition as part of the derivation.
<br />

<ul>

<li>On their game sheets they should mark each word as True of False.</li>
<li>On  Game Day, find a place where teams can spread out, and give each team a sign saying True and one saying False.</li>
<li>As you say each word from the sheet, teams hold up the sign they think is correct. Reveal the answer, and have students record a point in their box if they held up the correct sign.</li>
<li>Teams of three work well so one person is in charge of the True sign, one the False sign, and one marking the points in the boxes.</li>
<li>Add up points at the end.</li>
