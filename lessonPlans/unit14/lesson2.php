<li>One verb is chosen from their homework lists and plugged aloud into the verb test.</li>	
<li>If it passes the test as a regular verb, it is listed on the sheet of regular verbs; if not, with the irregular verbs.</li>
<li>Each group should go through all of their verbs individually and end up with a substantial list of regular and irregular verbs from their group.</li>
<li>As the groups finish, have them cover the board with irregular verb infinitives.</li>
<li>A regular verb is one that follows this given pattern for the simple present and simple past tenses.</li>

<li>An irregular verb is one that does not follow this common pattern.</li>
<li>It is amazing how many verbs in the English language are irregular.</li>
<li>Most verbs are irregular just in the simple past tense, but are perfectly regular in the present tense.</li>
<li><strong>to do, to have, to be</strong> are perhaps the most irregular verbs.</li>
<li>Share lists and save for use in later exercises.</li>
