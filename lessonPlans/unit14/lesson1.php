<ul>
<li>Conjugate <strong>to look</strong> in English in simple present and past tenses.</li>
<li>Notice all changes from the infinitive form: 
<br />	  3 sg. present  -s
<br />	  all past forms -ed</li>
<li>This is a regular verb in English. These are the regular inflections.</li>
<li>Conjugate <strong>to see</strong>.</li>
<li>The present is regular, but the past is irregular, a completely different word, saw.</li>
<li>Have students conjugate the verbs <strong>to do</strong> and <strong>to have</strong> on the board in simple present and past tenses.</li>
<li>In addition to the past being irregular, the present of each is slightly irregular in 3 sg. (although they retain the regular -s inflection).</li>
<li>But some verbs are very irregular, most of the forms are different words. What do you think is the most irregular English verb?</li>
<li>Conjugate <strong>to be</strong>.</li>
<li>None of the simple present or past forms even resemble the infinitive.</li>

<ul>
<li>The verb <strong>to be</strong> is the most irregular verb in most languages.</li>
<li>Why might this be the most common irregular verb? It is the most commonly used verb.</li>
<li>Perhaps something like the Whisper-Down-the-Lane theory happened with this verb. Since it is the most used, it is subject to the most change.</li>
<li>The verbs <strong>to have</strong> and <strong>to do</strong> are other frequently used verbs and common irregular verbs, although they are not nearly as irregular as <strong>to be</strong>.</li>
<li>Have students recap what you have discussed by filling in pages 109-111 there in class.</li>
