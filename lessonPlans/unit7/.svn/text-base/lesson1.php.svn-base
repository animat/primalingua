<ul>
<li>Every student sits on the floor in a circle holding his noun. One student starts by holding up his noun and describing it with an adjective.
<br />
      e.g.  a student holds up a notebook and says a thin notebook
</li>
<li>The student then passes his noun to the next person who describes the noun with a different adjective. This is not a memory game in which each student tries to remember all of the adjectives. Each student just has to think of a new adjective to describe the noun.
</li>
<li>When everyone has had a turn, the next student will start with his noun. And so on...
<br />
Don't accept duplicate adjectives. Make them struggle to find something different. They will be amazed at how many adjectives they know.
</li>
<li>If two students have brought in the same object, then pass the two objects together to be described by one adjective.  If everyone has a different object, then create a plural for at least one of the turns.
<br />
      e.g. the beautiful necklaces, the long necklaces, the shiny necklaces 
</li>

 <div class="discuss">

<ul>
<li>Even if the noun becomes plural, the adjective does not.
  In English we do not say the beautifuls necklaces</li>
<li>Define noun and adjective</li>
</ul>
