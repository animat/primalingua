<em>Acies - the straight line of battle</em>
<br />
 
   <li>Divide the class into three groups. The members of each group sit in acie, in a straight line, one behind the other, facing the board.</li> 
<li>The first person from each team goes up to the board, so there are three students at the board.</li>
<li>You will call out a word, a phrase, or a sentence in English, and they will race to write it in Latin on the board. It does not have to be done as a race. You can assign points for the first correct answer or for all correct answers.
</li>
<li>Start with a noun and an adjective. They will have to have correct adjective placement and agreement.<br />
    e.g. the good school , schola bona
<li>These students go and sit at the end of the line, the line moves up, and the next students take a turn.<br />
<li>Make one change or addition to your original phrase with each turn.<br />
Change it to plural, add the verb 'to be', change the feminine noun to a masculine noun.<br /> 
Make noun = adjective sentences and noun adjective = adjective sentences.<br />
    e.g. The school is good. The good school is big.<br /><br />

Make a fresh start after five or six turns have passed.<br />
<li>Tell them the word et = and. 
</li>
<li>While you are playing in this way, reviewing vocabulary and the grammar that has been learned, slip in these new agreement combinations, so that in the course of play, they are figuring out new material on their own.
<br /><br />
sing. noun + sing. noun = pl. adjective<br />
    e.g. Taurus et asinus sunt mali.<br /><br />

masc. noun + fem. noun = masc. pl. adjective<br />
    e.g. Discipulus et discipula sunt boni.<br /><br />

While the students are at the board trying to figure these out, ask leading questions about what genders and numbers they think they should use for the adjectives. </li>

<ul>
<li>Write every vocab word, old and new, on an index card and deal cards out to students. Have students come up to the board one by one and write the Latin nouns. They have to put all of the nouns that end in -a in one list and all that end in -us in another list.</li>
<li>Define declension: a group of nouns that have the same endings.</li>
<li>Label the first list 1st declension and the second list 2nd declension.</li>
<li>Look again at the list of Latin nouns in the vocabulary section. Instead of identifying them by gender, now have the students identify them by declension.</li>

</ul>

   rule.<br /><br />

<b>Adjective Agreement Combinations</b><br />
Two singular nouns being described together use a plural adjective.<br />
                               <b>sg. noun + sg. noun = pl. adj.</b><br />
Any combination of masculine and feminine nouns being described together use the masculine form of the adjective.<br />
                              <b>masc. noun + fem. noun = masc. pl. adj.</b>
