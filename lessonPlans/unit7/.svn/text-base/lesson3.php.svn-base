 You will need some props representing two of the new Latin
  nouns. I have a lot of toy frogs and a horse. You could adjust the vocabulary to fit what props you have, bears/ursae, perhaps, or simply use a discipulus and a discipula. You are going to act out some Latin adjectives.
Do not speak any English.

<br /><br />

Put a rana or discipula in the middle of the floor. Demonstrate that the rana is big compared to another small one, good compared to a bad one, while you repeat the phrases
<br />
<em>rana magna, rana parva, rana bona, rana mala</em>
<br /><br />
I usually caress the rana bona and throw the rana mala in the trash can after a good scolding. Exaggerate that one is big by stretching your arms and using a deep voice while saying rana magna and that one is small by crouching down and using a high voice to say rana parva.
<br /><br />
Repeat all of this using a masculine noun.
<br /><br />
Allow the students to figure out what these news words mean, and ask them not to speak English either until you are finished.

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>
	
<ul>
<li>Write the new Latin adjectives on the board in their masculine and feminine forms and allow the students to tell you what they mean and what the difference is between the two forms. Use the term gender.</li>
<li>Refer to Observations #1 and #2 pointing out that you were saying the adjectives after the nouns and that the adjectives changed to masculine forms when you changed to a masculine noun.</li>
<li>Review the list of nouns and add the adjective bonus/bona to each noun.</li>
<li>An adjective has to have masculine and feminine forms if the nouns in a certain language have masculine and feminine forms.</li>
<li>Add new vocabulary to notebooks. Have students guess the meanings of the nouns by providing clues.</li>
<li>Discuss ways to memorize vocabulary (using derivatives, silly gimmicks)</li>
</ul>

  Divide students into groups and give them 10 minutes to
 practice a way to present the 10 Little Ranae song. They can sing it and dance, act it out, or make up a new song. You could make this part of the previous night’s homework.<br /><br />

Finish class with presentations of song.
