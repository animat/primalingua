Act out the same words that you did in Lesson 3, but
 this time say the phrases as sentences. Again, do not speak English.<br /><br />

    e.g. Rana bona est. Rana mala est.  Equus bonus est. etc.<br /><br />

Now make plural sentences.<br /><br />

    e.g. Ranae magnae sunt. Equi parvi sunt.

<ul>
<li>Now ask the students if they figured out what you were saying.
</li>
<li>Write the sentences that you used on the board, and ask them to translate.
</li>
<li>Figure out in what ways the adjectives had to change to agree with the nouns they were describing. 
</li>
<li>Modify Observation #2
</li><br /><br />
<b>Observation #2 Adjective Agreement</b><br />
<b>English</b><br /> 

   The adjective does not change when the noun changes.<br />
 Adjectives do not become plural or change gender. 
<br /><br />
<b>Other languages</b><br /> 
The adjective changes if the noun changes.  <br />Adjectives agree with nouns in 
    gender (masculine, feminine) and<br />
    number (singular, plural)<br /><br />

<li>So they must know four forms for every adjective that they know in Latin:</li><br />
         masc. sg.(bonus) masc. pl.(boni)<br />
 fem. sg.(bona) fem. pl.(bonae)



</ul>

 Students can make a guess orally or in writing before the sentence is flipped to change its number.

<ul>
 <li>Look at one of the basic Latin sentences that is written on the
  board and at its English translation. Have the students figure out what words are missing in Latin that we have supplied in English.<br />
    e.g. Rana est bona. The frog is good. It is a good frog.<br /><br />

Look at the chart of articles on p. 46<br /><br /></li>
<li>Articles: definite (the) and indefinite (a, an) do not exist in Latin. We have to supply them when we translate into English.
</li>
<li>The definite articles in the Romance languages, however, come from the Latin word for that, ille / illa and the indefinite come from the number one.
o Note that the articles in these languages change gender and number, as do their adjectives.
</li>
<li>English articles do not change gender and number.</li>
<li>Give examples in any languages that you can of article / noun / adjective phrases to show how they fit into the adjective Rule #2<br />
    e.g. el hombre hermoso, la mujer hermosa (Sp.) 
</li>
