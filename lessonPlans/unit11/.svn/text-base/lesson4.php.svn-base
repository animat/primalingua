Review pronunciation of pronouns in different languages. Refer to pronunciation tips on p.86. Have every student choose two languages besides English in which they will memorize the list of personal pronouns.	Give them time to practice with classmates in class, and homework time, then test each student orally.
<br /><br />
The goal is to get them into the rhythm of what a conjugation will sound like and to make the point that every language uses the same pattern of 1 sg. to 3 pl.
