The following lesson is all outlined in the attached <a href="http://www.primalingua.net/lessonPlans/files/11-conjugatingWithPronouns.ppt">PowerPoint</a> and also on pp.84-85. Refer to charts of conjugations in these two places.
<br />
<ul>

<li>Have a student name all of the subject forms of the personal pronoun. List them on the board in order with the labels 1 sg. - 3 pl.</li>
<li>If these are subjects, then they must be able to do verbs. Write the verb 'to see' after each pronoun.
<br />
<table width="400" border="1" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td>1 sg.</td>
		<td>I see</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 sg.</td>
		<td>you see</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3 sg.</td>
		<td>he see</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1 pl.</td>
		<td>we see</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 pl.</td>
		<td>you pl. see</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3 pl.</td>
		<td>they see</td>
	</tr>

</table>
</li>

<li>This is called conjugating: joining together in a list all of the people who do the verb. It is from the same root as conjunction.</li>
<li>If you were to write a story in the 3rd person, you would use he, she, they. A story in the 1st person would use I, we.</li>
<li>One of the conjugated forms of 'to see' has a different ending: 3sg.</li>
<li>What would happen if you took away the personal pronouns from the conjugation? You would know that sees is 3 sg., but you would not know who was doing the other  forms. The pronoun tells us who the subject is.</li>
<li>Conjugate the verb 'to be' on the board. "I am" to "they are." Take away the pronoun. Only the form am is unambiguous.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<strong>
Conclusion:  the subject pronouns are completely necessary when conjugating an English verb to tell who is doing the action.
</strong>

<br /><br />
Conjugate videre in Latin using the Latin personal pronouns.
<table width="400" border="1" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td>1 sg.</td>
		<td>video</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 sg.</td>
		<td>vides</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3 sg.</td>
		<td>videt</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1 pl.</td>
		<td>videmus</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 pl.</td>
		<td>videtis</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3 pl.</td>
		<td>vident</td>
	</tr>

</table>
<br />
What happens if you take away the pronouns? Nothing. They are not needed. They are used only for emphasis.
<br /><br />
<strong>
Conclusion: Latin is highly inflected. English is only slightly inflected.
</strong>
<br /><br />

Conjugate the verb 'to see' in Italian, Spanish, French, and German. Underline the inflections.
<ul>

<li>In Latin, Spanish, and Italian the verbs forms all have different endings, so if the pronoun were not there, you would still be able to see that different people are doing the verb. The subject is in essence built into the inflection.
<br />
In these languages, using personal pronouns as subjects is not necessary.</li>
<li>In German and English, some of the forms have identical endings, so there would be confusion about who is doing the action if there were no personal pronoun.
<br />
In these languages, using personal pronouns is necessary.</li>
<li>In French, almost all of the forms look different, but many of them sound identical when spoken, even though they look very different.
<br />
<em>vois, voit, voient</em> sound exactly the same
<br />
In this language, using the personal pronoun is necessary, because four forms sound identical.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>
Conclusion: In any given language, if the verb inflections not only look but also sound completely different, then there is no need to use personal pronouns.
