<li>Whenever a personal pronoun is mentioned from the homework, put it on the board in the list. Put subject forms in the first list and object forms in the second but do not label the lists. Keep asking for sentences until you have filled in the list, but do not tell them what you are doing.</li>
<li>Before class write the subject forms of the personal pronouns on 8" x11" cards or poster board. Write the object forms on the backs of the cards.
<br />	 I - me
<br />	 you - you
<br />	 he - him
<br />	 she - her
<br />	 it - it
<br />	 we - us
<br />	 you pl. - you pl.
<br />	 they - them</li>
<li>Put two chairs in the front of the room, facing the rest of the class. One is for you. Choose a student to sit in the other. Keep the I - me card for yourself. Give the we - us card to the student sitting next to you in the front of the class. Hand out the rest of the cards to other students.</li>
<li>You are going to recreate the activity you did with your class prop (my frog) when you introduced subjects and direct objects. People with cards will do an action to the frog, such as hit the frog, while you narrate.
<br />	 First hit the frog yourself. I am hitting the frog.
<br />	 Have your partner join you in hitting the frog. We are hitting the frog.
<br />	 Give the frog to the two people holding the they card. They are hitting the frog.
<br />	 Talk directly to the person holding the you card. You are hitting the frog.
<br />	 Have a book hit the frog. It is hitting the frog.</li>
<li>Have people hold up their cards as you narrate the sentences.</li>
<li>Now change the action. Walk around to the people with the cards and make the frog hit them.</li>
<li>Ask them to turn their cards over as you narrate the new sentences.
<br />	 The frog is hitting me.
<br />	 The frog is hitting him, her, them, us, you, it.</li>

<li>The two sides of the cards are performing different functions. One side was a subject, the other was an object form of the same word. </li>
<li>These are called personal pronouns.</li>
<li>English is an inflected language too.</li>
<li>Some pronouns look as if they have come directly from the Latin accusative case: him, them.</li>
<li>In English we use the predicate nominative after linking verbs too, so we have to use the subject form of a pronoun after the verb 'to be.'
<br />
<em>	 e.g. This is she.</em></li>
<li>We memorize the subject pronouns in the order and label them 1st person singular to 3rd person plural.</li>
<li>Give examples of a book written in the 1st person or a person who speaks only in the 3rd person, like Elmo.</li>

<a href="http://www.primalingua.net/lessonPlans/files/11-personalPronounSentences.ppt">PowerPoint game</a>
<br />
Put cards of pronouns from last lesson on the floor. Play in teams or just individually.
<br />
Display a sentence from the PowerPoint. The team has to find the correct pronoun from the pile of cards that is named by person and number in the sentence. They can run and hold them up to the screen.
<br />
Instead of using this PowerPoint game, you could have teams write their own sentences and label blanks with person and number. You can check as they write them, write the PowerPoint on the spot in class, and play the game at the end.
