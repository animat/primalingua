		  Return to the discussion of language families.
  Just as individuals in real families, languages might share some common characteristics or history, but could have individual features that make them look or act very different from another language in the same family.  e.g. Russian with a different alphabet in the same family as English

	<strong>Language Family Tree</strong> <br /><br />
Students choose one of the major language families and drag languages onto the tree to se if they belong to this family.
The goal is not that they learn the names of all of the languages in a particular family or that they know the answers before they play the game. The object is simply exposure to languages that are grouped together in the same family and to the names of these families.

<strong>Indo-European</strong><br /><br />
 Look again at the Indo-European language family tree on the game from yesterday.
 <ul>  <li>Indo-European is not a language that is used or even known now. 
</li>
<li>All of the languages written under Indo-European have their origin in this ancient language.
 
</li>
<li>Even languages that are greatly different from each other, even using different alphabets, have things in common, because they can each trace their roots back to this language that may have been used thousands of years ago.

</li>
<li>Look at a map to see what a great expanse is covered by India and Europe.
 
</li>
<li>Look at all of the other areas of the world. The Western World uses Indo-European languages because of expansion of people who spoke Indo-European-based languages. 
 
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>
	<ul><strong>Branches of Families</strong>
 



		<li>A family can be broken down into branches. Consider the branches of your own family: uncles, cousins. etc. </li>
		<li>Look at page 18 to see the branches of Indo-European.</li>
	</ul>

<div class="play">

	<strong>Cargo Copter</strong><br /><br />   
Names of Indo-European languages will appear at the top. The correct branch to which they belong must be click for the helicopter to deliver its cargo there. Same goals as for Language Family Tree but now considering the branches of this one major language family.
