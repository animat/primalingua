	<ul>
		  Before beginning this unit, students need to do 
 two things. First they need to complete page 13. 
Usually workbook pages are done after activities and discussions in class. This page is done in preparation.

Second, they need to make a Boggle game board. These preparation activities can be assigned as homework or you can take a day or two of class time for this preparation.

The Boggle Board: students make a game board for themselves out of any material. Boxes on the game board will each contain the name of a language. Motivated students may make a game board with 100 boxes; others may make one with 25. You could set a requirement or just leave it to them that the more languages they have, the more points they might get. Ask them not simply to copy and paste a website that lists names of languages.

  board and a pen. Groups play individually.
One person on the team names a language. Everyone in the group who has that language crosses it off their board and scores a point for themselves.
If nobody has it, then the person who named the language gets 2 points.
continue until all languages have been named.

Language Families
 Introduce the fact that although there are all of these different languages in the word, they are grouped into families, just as people are.

<h4>Day 3</h4>


<div class="items">
<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
 This day could be skipped and done simply as a homework assignment after the last lesson or could be done as a work day in a computer lab or library.

Pages 14-15.
Students choose 5 languages to do some mini research on.
Using links from the website, students should list as many countries as they can where each language is spoken, highlighting a country of origin. 
They create a color or design code for each language and then plot on the map with the code where each language is spoken.

	<ul>
		<li>Review pages 14-15. Project the map from the
  workbook and have some students color code the countires where some languages are spoken from their results.
</li>
		<li>Spread of languages - how? why? where?
</li>
<li>Which languages seem to be spoken in many different
   areas of the world?

</li>
		<li>How did this come to be? Why is Spanish spoken in South America?

</li>
<li>Consider the "Whisper down the lane" experiment. Do you think this is how different dialects of the same language occur in different areas?

</li>
		<li>The name of the people is not necessarily the name of the language.
 e.g. Americans speak English
