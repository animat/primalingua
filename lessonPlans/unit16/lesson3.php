<h2>Unit 16 - Tenses</h2>

<h3>Lesson 3 - Helping verbs, the future</h3>

<div class="day">

<h4>Day 1:</h4>

<div class="items">

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	 
<ul>

<li>Ask students to copy conjugations of all tenses onto the board.</li>
<li>Erase all the personal pronouns.</li>
<li>Erase all words that are a form of the word walk.
<br />
<em>e.g. walking, walked</em></li>
<li>What is left? These words that are left were a part of the whole verb form. Although they can stand alone as verbs, they are not the verbs being used here. They are simply helping verbs here. They help to make up the different forms for different tenses.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>

<ul>
	
<li>What common verbs are used as helping verbs? (to be, to have, to do)</li>
<li>Perhaps this is why these verbs are irregular. They are not only used on their own as verbs very frequently, but they are used with all other verbs to make up the different tenses. And again, the more a word is used, the more chance it has to be changed through time, mutated, made irregular. Were they once regular?</li>
<li>Verb forms are made up of different parts. A form might include a personal pronoun, a helping verb, and a participle.</li>
<li>How can you tell when to be is being used as a helping verb and when it is simply a linking verb?
<br />The helping verb will be followed by a participle.
<br />The linking verb will be followed by a predicate nominative, a noun or adjective or pronoun. (It might be directly followed by an article.)</li>

</ul>

</div>

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>

<ul>
<li>What will you do when you go home today?</li>
<li>What will you have done before you go home but after this class today?</li>
<li>Put two marks on the time line to the right of the present point.
<br /><br />
The one farthest to the right designates an action that will happen after now.
<strong>Future: I will swim for an hour after school.</strong>
<br /><br />
The point to the left designates an action that will happen after now but before the  other action in the future.
<strong>Future perfect: I will have changed before I go to the pool.</strong></li>
<li>Write a schedule of the day noting what time it is at that moment in class. Have students give actions in past tenses for what happened at school before the present time and in future tenses for what is yet to come.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>

Again, perfect means completed, and so future perfect describes an action completed but in the future, completed before another action in the future.
