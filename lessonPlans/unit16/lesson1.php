<li>Draw a simple time line on the board with a point in the middle which is labeled present.</li>
<br />
<img src="present-tense.gif">
<br />
<li>Everything to the left of present has happened before now. It is the past.</li>
<li>Everything to the right of the present point is still to happen. It is the future.</li>
<li>Ask students if they have encountered a time line in math or history. Compare and contrast them.
<br />
<em>e.g. counting backwards in numbers as you move left, going farther forward in history as you move to the right.</em></li>
<li>The tense of a verb tells when the verb is being done. The present tense is used for an action that is happening now.</li>
<li>There are six tenses that are common to most languages. English has twelve variations of these six tenses.</li>
</ul>

<li>List three different types of present.
<br />
<em>e.g. I eat. I am eating. I do eat.</em></li>
<li>They are all happening now, but we use them in different ways.</li>
<li>Ask students to think up situations in which they would use these three different types.
<br />
<em>e.g. Dogs eat bones.
<br />	       I am eating dinner right now.
<br />	       I do eat artichokes.</em></li>
<li>Name each type of present:
<br />
<em>	e.g. Dogs eat bones. [general fact]
<br />	       I am eating dinner right now.    [in progress]
<br />	       I do eat artichokes. [affirming] ( Someone has either said that you do not eat artichokes or has asked you if you do or not; you are affirming that you do.)</em></li>
<li>Conjugate fully these three types of present with a regular verb:</li>

<li>Note that a verb form can be more than one word, and note where there are inflections and where the participle is used as part of the verb form.  (more on helping verbs later)</li>
<li>Introduce the story they will write for homework and let them start to work on this.</li>
