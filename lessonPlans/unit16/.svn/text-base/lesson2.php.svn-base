<ul>

<li>Share news report stories by setting up a newscast desk at the front of the room.</li>
<li>Take a few of the paragraphs and ask students to change all of the present verbs into past tenses.
<br />
<em>e.g. I walked. I was walking. I did walk.</em>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="activity">

<ul>
	
<li>What happened in gym or P.E. class yesterday?</li>
<li>Tell the students that you are looking for a variety of ways to say things in the past. 
<br />Write down all of the actions that they describe from gym class.
<br />Lead them into saying some of the less familiar forms of past tenses by asking them questions in those tenses.
<br />
<em>e.g. What have you done up until now in gym?
<br />What had the teacher taught you to do before that?</em>
<li>Have them brainstorm six versions of past tenses.
<br />
<em>e.g. We kicked.
<br />	        We have kicked.
<br />	        We did kick.
<br />	        We used to kick.
<br />	        We were kicking.
<br />	        We had kicked.</em>
</li>
<li>Plot them roughly on the time line without naming the different past tenses. Make one point in the past for a form that indicates one completed action. Make repeated strokes in the past for forms that indicate repeated action in the past. Make an extended wavy line for extended action, etc.</li>
	
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Two common tenses that occur in the past in many languages are the <strong>perfect</strong> tense and the <strong>imperfect</strong> tense.</li>
<li>If a student hands in a paper, and the teacher returns it saying that it is perfect, then that means that the student's work is completed; there is nothing more he can do; his work is perfect or completed.
<br />
If a student's work is handed back labeled imperfect, then that student has to do it over and over until it is completed; it is imperfect / not completed once.</li>
</li>The perfect tense describes action that was completed once in the past. The imperfect tense describes action that was either repeated in the past or that happened over a period of time, not in one completed action.</li>
<li>The <strong>pluperfect</strong> is the third past tense. Plu = plus = more. The pluperfect is more in the past than the perfect tense. A pluperfect action had happened before another action in the past.</li>

</ul>

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	
<ul>
<li>Have the students try to figure out which forms of the verb to kick from above belong to which past tenses.</li>
<li>Plot the names of the tenses on the time line.</li>
<li>Perfect:  We kicked.
<br />
- We have kicked.
<br />
- We did kick.
<br />
Imperfect: We used to kick.
<br />
- We were kicking.
<br />
- We kicked.
<br />
Pluperfect:  We had kicked.

Two verb forms look identical, but the difference can be figured out by the context.
<br /><br />
<strong>We kicked the ball to Martha, but she missed the pass.</strong>
<br />
Perfect: this is a completed action.
<br /><br />
<strong>We kicked the ball every time we got near the goal.</strong>
<br />
Imperfect: a repeated action in the past.
<br /><br />
Pluperfect would be before either of those past actions occurred.
<br /><br />
<strong>I had passed him the ball, so he was able to make a goal.</strong>
