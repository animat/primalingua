<ul>
<li>In the unit on prepositions, we found many words that used Latin prepositions as prefixes.</li>
<li>We can also look at one stem of a word and build many new words out of it by attaching different prefixes to it.</li>
<li>We can then change the parts of speech of these words by adding different suffixes to them, and build even more new words.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">Discuss</span>
	
<ul>
<li>Look at the lists of prefixes, of suffixes, and of stems of words on pages 146-147.</li>
<li>Discuss what each part means, and then let the students work in pairs to figure out the words on pp. 148-150 and then to build as many words as they can from all of these parts.</li>
<li>Have them check in the dictionary to see if their words truly are words and to see if they mean what they think they should mean.</li>
<li>Also have fun making up some ridiculous combinations:
<br />
<em> e.g. transfrogviator = one who crosses frogs on the road</em>
</li>
</ul>

<br />

<strong>Prefixes:</strong> use the prepositions from Unit 12. Add <strong>pre-</strong> before; <strong>re-</strong> back, again; <strong>inter</strong> between, among

There are some other suffixes in Unit 10.
<br /><br />

<strong>Stems:</strong>: use stems of words that you know from Latin vocabulary
<br />
labor-
<br />
narr-
<br />
port-
<br />
ambul-
<br />
voc-
<br />
vid- / vis-
<br />
terr-
<br />
mon-
<br />
monstr-
<br />
ten-
<br />
mov-

puls-
<br />
<br />

<em>e.g. collaboration = state of working together
	<br />
     prefix + stem + suffix</em>
<br /><br />

This is a good activity with which to end the course, because the students really get the feel that they can work with language; they can change word forms, break apart words, and use another language to help them understand their own.

You can have them create their own words for homework and end by sharing their words with the class.
