		  <li>the meaning of first names of students
  e.g. Margaret means pearl or daisy

</li>
<li>any family traditions of naming
   e.g.  all the children in the family have names staring with J, or
the first daughter is named after the maternal grandmother, first son after paternal grandfather

	the discussion above could take the whole period; 
 students love to share their naming traditions,
but if you have extra time, you could do one of the following activities.<br /><br />

1. Make posters of first names<br />
2. Send students around to question free teachers or staff about their naming traditions and report back to the class.

  <ul>The word <strong>name</strong> in the languages listed on p.22 in 
 the workbook and derivatives from this such as <i>nominate, noun</i>.<br /><br />

<li>Roman names:    praenomen             nomen              cognomen
                              first name         family name           nickname
                                 Gaius                    Julius                 Caesar</li><br /><br />

The nomen was comparable to our last name, a family or tribe name.
 Prae = pre = before. The praenomen is the name before the nomen, comparable to our first names.<br /><br />

The cognomen is the nickname assigned to a branch of the family/tribe/gens. It might be a characteristic of someone in that branch of the family, or might be the name of a place that the head of that branch conquered. Caesar = curly-haired<br /><br />

Two sons bearing the same complete names as their father could be called Major and Minor - the bigger and the smaller.<br /><br />

Daughters took a feminine form of the father's nomen. So Gaius Julius Caesar's daughter would be Julia. <br /><br />

• Notice the masculine names end in -us and the feminine in -a. 
This chapter on names is introducing the linguistic study of gender in words. 
</ul>

</div>

<div class="activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>Try renaming the class with the Roman tradition. 
  Girls take their father's family name and make it feminine by adding -a. My father's name was Somerville, so I would be known as Somervilla instead of Margaret. When she marries she will add a feminine form of her husband's nomen. Somervilla Roberta.
Boys would take their father's name and could create a new cognomen. Douglus Robertus Left-Handed.<br /><br /> 

Are there any people in the class whose fathers have a brother, so there are two branches of the family with the same last name? Have them choose a cognomen for their family and for their uncle's family.
Let them have fun and experiment with the Latin -us and-a making names until they are comfortable with the gender endings.

 <ul>Review p.23 and the different cognomens.<br />
 Cicero = chickpea 
<li>Married woman would have father’s nomen made feminine and then add husband’s nomen made feminine.
e.g. the daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar marrying Marcus Tullius Cicero would have the name Julia Tullia.
</li>
<li>Have students share their mothers’ traditions for married names.</li><br /><br />

More than two children could result in the ordering of them by number using the Latin ordinal number for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. = Primus, Secundus, Tertius, Quartus, Quintus, Sextus
Gaius Julius Caesar's daughters could be named Julia Prima, Secunda, Tertia, etc. and Julilla, little Julia, for the last one.<br /><br />

List ordinal numbers from p.23 and have class braistorm derivatives of these words.<br />
  e.g.  Primus: primary, prime, Prima Lingua<br />
         Secundus: secondary<br />
         Tertius: tertiary<br />
         Quartus: quarter<br />
         Quintus: quintet<br />
         Sextus: sextuplets
