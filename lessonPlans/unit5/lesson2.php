Look at list of Roman names on p.24.<br /><br />
  Read them aloud to work on pronunciation. Pronunciation of foreign words will come as they listen to you, but give them these two pronunciation rules for Latin:<br /><br />
    <b>g</b> and <b>c</b> are hard sounds  as in good cook
    <b>v</b>  makes the w sound

<li>Pick out the genders by looking at the endings.
</li>
<li>Think of English versions of these Roman names.
</li>
<ul>

How does English turn a masculine name into a
  feminine one? <br />Look for patterns and endings that English uses to turn masculine names into feminine ones.<br /> 
  e.g. George - Georgette
</li>
<li>Think of other English words that have a masculine and a feminine form.
 <br />e.g. actor / actress
       <br />comedian / comedienne
</li>
<li>Introduce the fact that regular nouns, not just names, in many foreign languages have gender 

 
</li>

<div class="Activity">
	<span class="subtitle">Activity</span>
	Write the following two phrases on either side of a piece of poster board. Hold up the first while you ask a student. Turn it around so the student can read it while he responds.
      <li>Quid est nomen tibi?  (What is your name?)</li>
      <li>Nomen mihi est...       (My name is...)</li><br /><br />

Practice trying to confuse each other with these new versions of the Latin question.<br />
      Quid est nomen tibi?  What is your name?<br />
      Quid est nomen mihi?  What is my name?<br />
      Quid est nomen sibi?  What is his / her name?<br /><br />

      Nomen mihi / tibi / sibi est...   My / Your / His / Her name is...
