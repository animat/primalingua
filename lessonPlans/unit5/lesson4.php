<h4>Day 2</h4>


<div class="items">

<div class="discuss">
	<span class="subtitle">The Debate</span><ul>

Use terms pro and con and ask students to join a side. Give students the day with their group to prepare their arguments.<br><br>


Perhaps hold the debate in a special room.
 Students should come forward one at a time and alternating from one side to the other getting turns to present an point or to counter a point presented by the opposing side.<br><br>

Some classes want to continue the debate for two days. Give groups ten minutes at the end to prepare a final statement and to elect one person to present it.<br><br>
tudents may be anxious to know which side won, but you can handle that as you decide. I do not bring it to that resolution but rather tell them that they will have to be able to argue either side for the test.       <br><br>
