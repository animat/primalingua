				Before taking roll or making any greeting to the students
on the first day, go to each student individually, shake hands, and say <b>salve</b> (hello in Latin.) Look at the whole class and say <b>salvete</b> (the plural form.) Repeat this until they start to catch on that you say one form to one person and the other to more than one person.

					<li> Some languages have different forms of the same word to perform different functions.</li>
					<li> In English there aren't different endings on the word <em>hello</em>, but in Latin there are.</li>
					<li> In English, however, we do have different words and different ways to give a greeting.</li>

				What was the first language? Was it one of the languages mentioned in the Hello activity, i.e. Latin? Imagine before there were even humans speaking on earth. Perhaps the first language was between animals. Brainstorm in groups or as a class: 
				<ul>
					<li> What do animals have to communicate? (food location, danger, mating)</li>
					<li> How do animals communicate these things? (vocally, gestures, scents)</li>
					<li> Do different animals have different forms of communication? (e.g. Bees dance to tell where flowers are)</li>
					<li> What type of language did primitive humans first use?</li>
