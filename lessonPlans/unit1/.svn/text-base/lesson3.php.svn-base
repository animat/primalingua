Students in groups of four. You are going to dinner together. Figure out where, when, how to get there, what to eat.
You cannot speak or write any words to do so. When they have all finished they should individually write down the answers they obtained to see if everyone in the group has the same.

<ul>
	<li>Words can be spoken or gestured, written or drawn</li>
	<li>There are ways to communicate other than with words </li> <li>But only basic ideas are communicated without words</li>
	<li>If we want to talk about more interesting and more complicated things, we not only need to use words, but we need to form a more complex language with these words. During this course we will learn how to fiddle with words to make them communicate a greater variety of ideas.</li>
