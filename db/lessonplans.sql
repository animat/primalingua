Underline the inflections.\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>In Latin, Spanish, and Italian the verbs forms all have different endings, so if the pronoun were not there, you would still be able to see that different people are doing the verb. The subject is in essence built into the inflection.\r\n<br />\r\nIn these languages, using personal pronouns as subjects is not necessary.</li>\r\n<li>In German and English, some of the forms have identical endings, so there would be confusion about who is doing the action if there were no personal pronoun.\r\n<br />\r\nIn these languages, using personal pronouns is necessary.</li>\r\n<li>In French, almost all of the forms look different, but many of them sound identical when spoken, even though they look very different.\r\n<br />\r\n<em>vois, voit, voient</em> sound exactly the same\r\n<br />\r\nIn this language, using the personal pronoun is necessary, because four forms sound identical.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>\r\nConclusion: In any given language, if the verb inflections not only look but also sound completely different, then there is no need to use personal pronouns.\r\n</strong>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div> <!-- end items -->\r\n\r\n<div class="reminders">\r\n\r\n<span class="subtitle">Homework</span>\r\n<div class="hw">\r\npages 84-85\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span class="subtitle">Term</span>\r\n<div class="term">\r\nto conjugate\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div><!-- end reminders -->\r\n\r\n</div> <!-- end day -->\r\n\r\n</div><!-- End lesson -->');
