The subject is in essence built into the inflection.\n<br />\nIn these languages, using personal pronouns as subjects is not necessary.</li>\n<li>In German and English, some of the forms have identical endings, so there would be confusion about who is doing the action if there were no personal pronoun.\n<br />\nIn these languages, using personal pronouns is necessary.</li>\n<li>In French, almost all of the forms look different, but many of them sound identical when spoken, even though they look very different.\n<br />\n<em>vois, voit, voient</em> sound exactly the same\n<br />\nIn this language, using the personal pronoun is necessary, because four forms sound identical.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>\nConclusion: In any given language, if the verb inflections not only look but also sound completely different, then there is no need to use personal pronouns.\n</strong>\n</div>\n\n</div> <!-- end items -->\n\n<div class=\"reminders\">\n\n<span class=\"subtitle\">Homework</span>\n<div class=\"hw\">\npages 84-85\n</div>\n\n<span class=\"subtitle\">Term</span>\n<div class=\"term\">\nto conjugate\n</div>\n\n</div><!-- end reminders -->\n\n</div> <!-- end day -->\n\n</div><!-- End lesson -->", :created_at => "2013-07-12 18:09:48", :updated_at => "2013-07-12 18:09:48" },
